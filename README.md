# Kafka_Twitter_Data

This Python code retrieves tweets containing a specific hashtag from Twitter and sends them to a Kafka topic. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:

1. Imports: Libraries required for Twitter streaming (tweepy.streaming), authentication (tweepy), Kafka interaction (kafka), and time management (time) are imported.


2. StdOutListener Class Definition: A class named StdOutListener inherits from tweepy.streaming.Stream. It has the following methods:
__init__: Initializes the listener with a time_limit parameter.
on_data: This method is called whenever a new tweet is received. It checks if the streaming duration hasn't exceeded the time_limit. If within the limit:
Encodes the tweet data in UTF-8 format.
Sends the encoded data to the specified Kafka topic using the producer.send method.
Prints the tweet data to the console.
Returns True to continue listening.
on_error: This method handles any errors encountered during streaming and prints the error status.


3. Twitter Authentication: Placeholders are provided for your actual Twitter API credentials (access_token, access_token_secret, consumer_key, and consumer_secret). These are required to authenticate with Twitter.


4. Kafka Configuration: The Kafka endpoint address (kafka_endpoint) and topic name (kafka_topic) are defined.


5. Twitter Streaming Setup: A KafkaClient object (kafka) is created to connect to the Kafka server.
A SimpleProducer object (producer) is created to send messages to the Kafka topic.
An instance of the StdOutListener class (l) is created.
OAuth handler (auth) is initialized with your consumer key and secret.
Access tokens are set for authentication.
A Stream object (stream) is created using the authentication handler and listener.
The stream.filter method is used to filter tweets containing the specified hashtag (twitter_hash_tag) and start streaming.
Overall, this code demonstrates how to use the Twitter Streaming API with tweepy and send the retrieved tweets to a Kafka topic for further processing.
